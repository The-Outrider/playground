# Project Playground

## Introduction
Hey There, so this should be a simpler version to work in and experiment with.
We're using NGINX as the webserver for files, and Docker as the Virtual Machine.

## Getting Started
Run these commands in seperate terminals
```
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npm run watch
```

Then go to localhost and your index.html file should appear!
It's already got the CSS and JS files needed for bootstrap. 
So good luck and have fun!
